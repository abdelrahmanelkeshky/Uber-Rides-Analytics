# Uber Rides Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores Uber rides data to uncover insights into trip patterns, pricing trends, peak demand periods, and customer behavior. The analysis is conducted using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on Uber rides, including:
- **Pickup and Dropoff Locations** (latitude & longitude)
- **Timestamps** (date & time of rides)
- **Trip Distance**
- **Fare Amounts**
- **Passenger Count**
- **Weather Conditions (if applicable)**

## Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis
- Identify peak hours and busiest locations
- Analyze fare trends based on distance and time of day
- Examine seasonal variations in ride demand
- Visualize geographic ride distribution

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Geopandas (for mapping), Scikit-learn (if ML is applied)
- **Visualization Tools**: Power BI / Tableau (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

## Notebooks and Code Structure
- `data_cleaning.ipynb` – Preprocessing and handling missing values
- `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` – Data visualization and insights
- `geospatial_analysis.ipynb` – Mapping ride locations
- `fare_analysis.ipynb` – Pricing trends and demand fluctuations
- `predictive_model.ipynb` – Optional: Predicting ride demand using ML

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uber-rides-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the notebooks and execute cells sequentially.

## Results & Insights
Key findings from the analysis will be updated here. Example insights include:
- Peak demand occurs between 6-9 AM and 5-8 PM.
- Average fares are highest during late-night hours.
- Demand surges on weekends and during bad weather conditions.
